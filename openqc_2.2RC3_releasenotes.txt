OpenQuotesAndContracts 2.0 Beta Release Notes
===============================================

Number of new features are introduced in 2.0. Unfortunately, it is increasedly difficult to keep backwards compatibility of new version with old code. Below is the list of the main changes in OQC behavior. We hope these small inconveniences are compensated by the new features :-).

Changelog:

*** VAT is handled only in new format. It is no longer required to set it in config file. Older quotes and contracts created with 1.7.7 version or earlier may indicate and calculate VAT incorrectly. It will be required to correct/re-enter VAT value for these items.
*** Old pdf creation templates are not compatible with new ones. The users will be required to convert old templates, using '<' and '>' as Smarty delimiters instead of '{{' and '}}'. New format results in much better readability of the code.
*** The ones that used textbloks with Smarty code will be required to modify due new Smarty delimiter. See manual for details.
*** New version is not tested with SugarCE 5.2. Only 6.x versions are supported. For work with 6.3 one has to disable AjaxUI for OQC modules (Goto to Admin-> Configure AjaxUI OR edit config_override.php to add entries like following: $sugar_config['addAjaxBannedModules']['0'] = 'oqc_Product'; and so on). Recommended to use 6.2.x together with PHP 5.3.x. Best rendering of user interface is observed when using Firefox or Opera.

Known issues:

*** In Create Attachment Popup the Calendar is loaded with some errors- the button icons are not shown (but buttons operate anyway).

New features:

*** Multiple product catalogs (prevents catalog growth to unmanageable size).
*** Product catalog can be configured for different currencies, global discount/markup selection (for pdf creation only).
*** Outdated Fck editor is replaced with TinyMCE that is included in SugarCE distribution.
*** Updated Scriptacoulous to 1.9.0.
*** Pdf creation inprovement, including
            1. Ability to set template for pdf creation from Editview.
            2. New html to latex convertor- written from scratch.
            3. Change in latex template format for easier editing (old templates will need replacement of some symbol sequences).
            4. Template creation manual for beginners.
            5. Pdf creation also will work on WAMP stack (except Document converter, atm tested on WinXP only).
*** Textblocks handling improvement - drag&drop re-ordering of FreeText textblock now is possible.
*** Textblocks are processed with Smarty before including into pdf files- see chapter 5.6 in manual for details.
*** New ProductOptions feature- "slave" products that can be included into quotes and contracts only together with "master" product.
*** It is possible to hide Reccuring Expenses Table from EditView and DetailView by setting hideRecurringTable parameter in config ( e.g. document.properties) file.


Bugfixes:
